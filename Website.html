		<h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>
		<p>Hi, My name is Nathan Hinch, and welcome to my website. <br> I am 14 years old, I am Canadian, and I was born and raised in Hong Kong. Ive Loved computers for as long as I knew what a computer was, I built my first computer when I was 11 years old, and never let go of that machine since day 1. I have played all sorts of videogames, ranging from Fortnite, to games like Terraria and minecraft. And at the time of writing this, my favorite game is Destiny 2. I love playing games with my friends, and I love video games for their ability to bring people all over the world together, I often play with my friends from halfway across the world!<br><img src="tricorn.jpg" height="200" width="320">(<em>Destiny's Logo</em>)<br>Humour is a great device for bringing people together. I feel I have a broad sense of humour, adaptable to almost whoever I'm speaking to, for example, I have a different sense of humour from my friends to my parents to sister. I get a lot of my humour from the internet, mostly from youtube, from people like: <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4sxB7lQ17CKRpFQpntloRg" target="_blank">Twomad</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheBlueCrewPros" target= "_blank">CallMeCarson</a>, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtb8P4rf_1n8KS8eZk_lNNw" target="_blank">Fitz</a>, etc.</p> <!--About me paragraph-->

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Videogames</li>
			<li>Tennis</li>
			<li>Drums</li>
			<li>Coding (<em>I would hope so</em>)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I love a lot of things, and I especially enjoy doing things with others, but these above are a list of things I enjoy the most.<br><br>
		
		I Have been playing tennis for roughly 6 years. Recently I went to a summer camp, in spain, which was a fun experience, as I had never been to spain before, and also, I had never done a summer camp before. Everyday we would do 5 hours of tennis, broken up with a 2 hour gym session in the middle. The summer camp was a week long, and I felt like I really improved because of it, I had gained a lot of experience, and I learned the spanish style of tennis training.<br><br>

		Drums have been apart of me for almost 2 years, and I have learned a lot, I can play all sorts of songs like Footloose, Back in black, Some reggae songs, and recently I learnt the blues song <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_4UmAY852I" target="_blank"> Five long years </a> by Buddy Guy. I idolize and really like Neil peart's/Rush's music <br> <img src="Rush.jpg" height= "250" width= "250" >(<em>Rush's Logo</em>)<br><br></p>
		
		Around about a year or two ago, I started to learn about what I wanted to do as a career when I get older, and I immidietly knew, I wanted to work with computers, I didn't know whether I wanted to learn code, or learn about hardware. And then at the start of a term in school, I learnt that I was going to participate in a class to get us introduced to code, the class was called "Systems design", we started with making a Virtual Reality game using codespaces. After that class I started to learn about code and robotics, and I also learned about what really goes in to the making of my favorite games, like Destiny, so I decided to look at their website to see the requirements for becoming an employee at Bungie(<em>The company that made Destiny1&2</em>) and the website stated that I needed a good understanding of C++, at the time, I really had no idea how to code, so I decided to try and learn C++, I used a website called <a href= "https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">"Codecademy"</a> to start to learn about C++, I gave up very quickly, as Learning a very difficult language as my first, was not a great idea at 13 years old. Coincidentally, I used <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">"Codecademy"</a> to learn HTML, (<em>The language this website was written in</em>) and I 
		really enjoyed learning HTML, as Codecademy suggests it as a great starter language.<br><img src="html.jpg" height= "250" width="250">(<em>HTML5</em>)</p>

		<h2>Hong Kong</h2>
		<p><img src="hk.jpg" height="200" width="280">(<em>Flag of Hong Kong</em>)<br>
		Hong Kong, officially the <strong>Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China</strong> is a metropolitan area and special administrative region of the People's Republic of China on the eastern Pearl River Delta of the South China Sea. With over 7.5 million people of various nationalities in a 1,104-square-kilometre (426 sq mi) territory, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places in the world.</p>
		
		<p>Growing up in Hong Kong wasn't a typical Movie-esc lifestyle, for one, we don't typically drive cars in Hong Kong, we take ferrys between the many islands that make up Hong kong just to get to work or school everyday. I go to an International school, which is very interesting, as I am attuned to everybody's culture and personality, and very aware to all sorts of cultures from around the world. We also learn about all the issues in the world, with no bias towards our own country, for example, local issues or government. <br><br> In my opinion, Hong kong is probably one of the best cities in the world when it comes to quality of life, with a lot of factors a lot of other cities or countries dont have, for example, Hong Kong is a very diverse place to live, learning about local and other cultures from all the way across the world. Hong Kong also has great public transport, it is a very small place, and a lot of moving around in Hong Kong is on foot, or by its train system "MTR", the MTR system is capable of taking you across the city in a matter of minutes.</p>
